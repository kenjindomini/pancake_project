## Seneca based micro service layer

### You don't need to fix these I need to get back around to them
#### Fix Broken Windows
* improve README.md
* simplify webpack build further
* complete webpack build for other than js pieces
* get hapi server more production ready vs. just development server
* make sensible directory structure for the fuller stack project
* integrate seneca layer beneath falcor router
* make slightly more complex data model to allow joins etc. to come into play
* figure out if PouchDB is the best DB to use here
* change data modeled over to be based on food and metrics over time vs. users
* check to see if node-dev is respecting --no-deps correctly
