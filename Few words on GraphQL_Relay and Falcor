GraphQL + Relay certainly solves the same concerns that falcor has set out to solve. It seems GraphQL + Relay require the client side developer to have a much deeper understanding of how the data is organized on the backend. From my experience with Falcor and what I can see of GraphQL + Relay, Falcor does a better job of abstracting away the complexities of an ever expanding backend. One of the benefits of the more complex GraphQL + Relay is you gain parameterized calls that are inline with the query, for example you could specify you want "users(sortDirection: 'asc', number: 10, skip: 10)" to get users at index 10-19 when the database is organized with ascending sort. GraphQL + Relay brings a bit more maturity to the table with GraphQL being about 3 years old and Relay being almost a year in the public and those familiar with React may pick up Relay faster than they would pick up Falcor.
